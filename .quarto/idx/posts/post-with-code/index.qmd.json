Describe and manipulate tabular, network, and spatial data; transform these data into a form suitable for visualization.\n2.  Make effective data visualization design choices related to marks and channels, spatial arrangement, and components of color.\n3.  Design effective data visualizations for tabular, network, and spatial data with quantitative and categorical attributes.\n4.  Implement their data visualization designs using existing tools in R (or other toolkits preferred by the student).\n5.  Explain whether a visual encoding is perceptually appropriate for a specific combination of task and data.\n6.  Demonstrate their skills with at least two novel visualizations suitable suitable for inclusion in an online Data Science Portfolio.\n\nThe course materials are located on [Canvas](https://canvas.uidaho.edu/courses/11081).\n:::\n\n## VISUALIZATION\n\nComputer-based systems provide [visual]{.red} representations of datasets designed to help people carry out tasks more effectively.\n\n### [Tamara Munzner]{.absolute top=\"450\" left=\"10\" }\n\n\n[Department of Computer Science]{.absolute top=\"500\" left=\"10\" }\n\n[[InfoVis Group](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/group/infovis/)]{.absolute top=\"540\" left=\"10\" }\n\n[University of British Columbia]{.absolute top=\"580\" left=\"10\" }\n\n![](VADcover.jpg){.absolute bottom=\"70\" right=\"10\" width=\"300\" }\n![](TamaraMunzner.jpg){.absolute top=\"240\" left=\"0\" width=\"300\" }\n\n## THE HUMAN\n\nWhy have a human in the loop?\n\nComputer-based visualization systems provide visual representations of datasets designed to help [people]{.red} carry out [tasks]{.red} more effectively.\n\nWe don't need visualiztion when a **trusted** fully automatic solution exists. Visualization is suitable when there is a need to augment human capabilities rather than replace people with computational decision-making methods.\n\n::: r-fit-text\n\nVisualization is useful when:\n\n-analysis problem is ill-specified and we don't know exactly what questions to ask in advance\n-long-term use for end users (ex: exploratory analysis of scientific data)\n-presentation of known results (ex: New York Times Upshot)\n-stepping stone to assess requirements before developing models\n-help automatic solution developers refine & determine parameters\n-help end users of automatic solutions verify, build trust\n:::\n\n\n\n## THE REPRESENTATION\n\nComputer-based visualization systems provide visual representations of datasets designed to help people carry out tasks more effectively.\n\n## WHY DEPEND ON VISION?\n\nComputer-based visualization systems provide visual representations of datasets designed to help people carry out tasks more effectively.\n\nhuman visual system is high-bandwidth channel to brain overview possible due to background processing subjective experience of seeing everything simultaneously significant processing occurs in parallel and pre-attentively sound: lower bandwidth and different semantics overview not supported subjective experience of sequential stream touch/haptics: impoverished record/replay capacity only very low-bandwidth communication thus far taste, smell: no viable record/replay devices\n\n## WHY REPRESENT (ALL THE) DATA?\n\nComputer-based visualization systems provide visual representations of datasets designed to help people carry out tasks more effectively.\n\nsummaries lose information, details matter confirm expected and find unexpected patterns assess validity of statistical model\n\n## ANSCOMBE'S QUARTET\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: true\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(grid)\nlibrary(gridExtra)\nlibrary(datasets)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(dplyr)\ndatasets::anscombe\n```\n\n##

take into account three very different kinds of resource limitations: those of computers, of humans, and of displays.\n\ncomputational limits computation time, system memory display limits pixels are precious & most constrained resource information density: ratio of space used to encode info vs unused whitespace tradeoff between clutter and wasting space find sweet spot between dense and sparse human limits human time, human memory, human attention\n\n## VISUALIZATION ANALYSIS AND DESIGN\n\n### ANALYSIS?\n\nimposes structure on huge design space scaffold to help you think systematically about choices analyzing existing as stepping stone to designing new most possibilities ineffective for particular task/data combination\n\n##
