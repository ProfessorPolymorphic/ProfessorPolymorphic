Data Science. Video Games.  Horror Fiction.\n\nI am a Professor of Biological Sciences at the University of Idaho, and the cofounder of [Polymorphic Games](http://www.polymorphicgames.com), an experimental video game studio that applies game development technology to scientific research and education.  We have released two evolutionary video games on Steam:\n\n[Darwin's Demons](https://store.steampowered.com/app/572020/Darwins_Demons/) is an rcade style space shooter in which you battle a population of evolving aliens. The alienâ€™s morphology, fire type, and behaviors are all encoded by a digital genome. The aliens that are best able to shoot or evade you reproduce to make the next generation.\n\n[Project Hastur](https://store.steampowered.com/app/800700/Project_Hastur/) is an evolutionary tower defense game. Defend humanity against the ever changing threat of the alien Proteans. Project Hastur combines elements of 3D tower defense and real-time strategy with models of biological evolution to create a uniquely challenging experience.\n\nI am also a huge Horror and Science Fiction nerd, and am fascinated by the intersection of these genres with science.\n\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"output-file":"about.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.203","editor":"visual","theme":"cosmo","title":"About","image":"grid_0.png","about":{"template":"broadside","links":[{"icon":"twitter","text":"Twitter","href":"https://twitter.com"},{"icon":"linkedin","text":"LinkedIn","href":"https://linkedin.com"},{"icon":"github","text":"Github","href":"https://github.com/ProfessorPolymorphic"}]}},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
